                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Se치n. I am currently in my fourth and final year of my degree. I am a full-time student at the Institute of Technology Tallaght.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I am currently studying IT Management. During my years here at IT Tallaght, I have gained a vast amount of information and skills through numerous variety of modules such as Web Development, Networking, System Admin, Database Admin, Software Development and Cloud Computing </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As part of my college degree, in third year I had to spend a whole semester doing work placement doing an IT based role. I did my internship at SAP, located in CityWest, Dublin. During my time at SAP I had worked on their cloud products, specifically their product SuccessFactors. During my time at SAP I had completed a lot of team and individual projects. My time at SAP and IT Tallaght has made me develop a lot of skills such as project management skills, communication skills, leadership skills, team skills, time management skills and many more. </p>

My dataset topic was involved on the terrorist attacks that have occured worldwide. I covered the terrorist attacks that occured from the year 2010 to 2018. In order to make a dashboard of the dataset I retrieved, I had to parse the data and get rid of any columns that were not needed. I created multiple dashboards for the user to gain information on this topic and also have a report to document my findings.</p>

There is also a dashboard which allows the user to see the current sprinkler status and smoke alarm status that is involved with each room. The publish and subscribe methods that was used in this project was with MQTT. These scripts were all written in bash.</p>

                                                            <p>I conducted an analysis on a Social Media platform. The goal of the project is to analyze the users interaction with a certain topic and whether they have any relataionship/connection to anyone else talking about that topic. The topic that I chose to anaylze was the topic 'Manchester United' and the social media platform I chose to do the analysis on was twitter. I analyzed over 4,000 tweets and users with the application NodeXL and I made a visualization of all groups and types of people who were speaking about Manchester United. I then documented my conclusions on the analysis and the different groups in a report.</p>

I done a thorough analysis on what type of options the pharmaceutical company had and done an in-depth analysis on why they should choose one option over the other. There were many factors that are to be considered such as cost, security and availability. In my report I have all options that should be considered and finally I have a conclusion and recommendation on what the pharmaceutical company should pick. </p>

                      <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
                      <p>Technology and Sports are the two interests and hobbies that I like to keep on top of. I am a huge sports fan, any sport is interesting to me although football and Gaelic Football are my two biggest sport interests. I go to every Dublin football match and I am part of the setup at my local GAA club, St Kevins/Killians. I also try to go over to England at least once a year to watch Manchester United, the football team I support. I also like to keep myself up-to-date with Technology as it is always evolving. My college courses also keep me up to date on technology too, especially with the cloud classes which is relatively new. I always try to be up to date with having the latest technology. </p>
